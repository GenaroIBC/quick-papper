# Quick Papper

## ðŸ“œ Description

Quick Papper is a fast, high-quality, AI-powered blog generator that helps you to create a draft of your blog idea. Then you can:

- `Regenerate` to get a variant of the original text.

- `Summmarize` to extract the main idea from a text.

- `Extend` the text and continue with the same context.

This project is part of the [Midudev-Cohere Hackaton](https://github.com/midudev/midu-cohere-hackathon), where the goal is to build a product using AI.
